\chapter{Measuring Performance}
\section{Single kmer-Index}
\subsection{Methods}

To further investigate the behavior implied by Lemmas 1, 2 and 3 a benchmark was conducted.
Using a single kmer-index for $k=10$, randomly generated queries of length $\{6,7,...,50\}$ were searched in a
randomly generated text and the search calls duration to return was measured.

\subsection{Results}

of given length using a kmer-index for$k=\{10\}$. The inset graph
shows a``zoomed in'' view of the area of query lengths$[16,29]$.
The dotted lines mark query lengths that are a multiples of$k$.}
