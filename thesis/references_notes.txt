### MEGAHIT ######################################

engine for denovo assembly of metagenomic data

succeinct de bruijin graphs:
    represents overlaps between sequences
    has m^n vertices, m = number of symbols, n = legnth of sequence
megahit uses compressed sdbg

" the bottleneck is sorting a set of (k+1)-mers that are the edges of an
SdBG in reverse lexicographical order of their length-k prefixes (k-mers)."

extracting k-mers from reads is vital, k-mer index speeds this up
