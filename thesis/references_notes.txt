### MEGAHIT ######################################

engine for denovo assembly of metagenomic data

succeinct de bruijin graphs:
    represents overlaps between sequences
    has m^n vertices, m = number of symbols, n = legnth of sequence
megahit uses compressed sdbg

" the bottleneck is sorting a set of (k+1)-mers that are the edges of an
SdBG in reverse lexicographical order of their length-k prefixes (k-mers)."

extracting k-mers from reads is vital, k-mer index speeds this up

### SOAP denovo #################################

de novo transcriptome (all RNA and mRNA reads of an organism) assembly

"very short reads (e.g. 2 Ã— 90 bp paired ends)" (this was 2014)

challenge: alterantive splicing = reordering parts of mRNA depending on non-genetic factors
polyploid = multiple sets of paired chromosomes

indexing reads as well as querying for overlaps all involve kmer-index
