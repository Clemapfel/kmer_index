### MEGAHIT ######################################

engine for denovo assembly of metagenomic data

succeinct de bruijin graphs:
    represents overlaps between sequences
    has m^n vertices, m = number of symbols, n = legnth of sequence
megahit uses compressed sdbg

" the bottleneck is sorting a set of (k+1)-mers that are the edges of an
SdBG in reverse lexicographical order of their length-k prefixes (k-mers)."

extracting k-mers from reads is vital, k-mer index speeds this up

### SOAP denovo #################################

de novo transcriptome (all RNA and mRNA reads of an organism) assembly

"very short reads (e.g. 2 Ã— 90 bp paired ends)" (this was 2014)

challenge: alterantive splicing = reordering parts of mRNA depending on non-genetic factors
polyploid = multiple sets of paired chromosomes

indexing reads as well as querying for overlaps all involve kmer-index

### MUSKET ERROR CORRECTION #####################
The core of substitution-error-based methods is to compute consensus bases
using the highly redundant coverage information. When a sequencing error
occurs in a read that originated from a certain position on the genome,
all reads covering the erroneous position could be piled up to compute
the consensus base. Considering that sequencing errors are generally random and infrequent, this consensus base is likely to be correct. However, as we assume that the source genome is unknown beforehand, we can neither determine the read locations on the genome nor the correctness of reads directly. Instead, reads that cover overlapping genomic positions can be inferred by assuming that they typically share common substrings. Furthermore, we can approximate the source genome using a k-mer spectrum, which was first introduced by Pevzner et al. (2001)
