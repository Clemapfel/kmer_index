Programming:
    set time stamp for each benchmark
    and record args for that time stamp in case gbenchmark doesn't
        print k etc

Benchmark Config:
    runtime per loop
    post to file
    how often to rerun benchmark?

Size & Construct:
    DA vs no-DA

Search:
    exact vs approximate
    DA vs non-DA
    query_size = k
    query_size = n*k
    query_size % k != 0
    querys in text vs not in text

Graphs Needed:

    Construction Time
        DA vs no DA
        k
        alphabet size

    Size After Construction
        DA vs no DA: when maximum reached for no DA
            for small k when is DA worth it?
        k
        alphabet size

    Exact Search Time
        DA vs no DA
        n queries
        alphabet size
        query_size
            = k
            = n*k
            % k != n
                n = 1, .., k-1
        multi k vs k: showcase
        n hits per query: 0 ... inf
        % of queries in batch that aren't in text
